# Pacman-Clone

A rendition of the popular arcade game Pacman made with vanilla Javascript

# Features

* A "game-win" condition of collecting all the pellets generated within the map
* Ghosts with movement that mock Artificial Intelligence with random selection of possible scenarios
* Two Power Up spawns that when the user collects one, the ghosts become scared for 10 seconds and Pacman can eat then upon contact
* Classic Pacman chomp animation

# What I Learned

* Using Object-Oriented programming techniques to communicate with different classes and formulate functions for interaction
* Practicing the use of data structures to store objects that will be populated within the bounds of the game
* Developed mathematical formulas to determine whether scenarios within the game are maked true 
  (i.e. collisions between user and ghost, collisions between user and pellets, and collisions between user and boundaries)
